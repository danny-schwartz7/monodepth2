To use the dataset that contains all of the drive data from kitti_data

make sure you are in the monodepth2 folder with kitti_data as a dir

mydataset also has a to_depth and to_disparity functions that given focalLength and baseline will compute depth from disparity 
vice versa

example usage for data set to make data loader: 
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset=MyDataset("train"), batch_size=args.batch_size)

the get item function returns:
tensor of left img (3, height, width)
tensor of right img (3, height, width)
tensor of left depth map (height, width)
tensor of right depth map (height, width)
a float with the focal length in pixels for this camera pair
a float with the baseline in pixels for this camera pair

returned schema: imgL, imgR, depth_gtL, depth_gtR, focalLength, baseline
