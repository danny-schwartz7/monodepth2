In order to use dataset_interface you may have to conda install pillow,

other than that the method should be fairly self contained and when initializing the data set
pass either "train", "test", or "eval" in order to switch between the different data sets
otherwise should be good

the get item function returns:
tensor of left img (3, height, width)
tensor of right img (3, height, width)
tensor of left depth map (height, width)
tensor of right depth map (height, width)
tensor of disparity transformation from left to righ  (3,4)
