To use the dataset that contains all of the drive data from kitti_data

make sure you are in the monodepth2 folder with kitti_data as a dir

mydataset also has a to_depth and to_disparity functions that given focalLength and baseline will compute depth from disparity 
vice versa

example usage for data set to make data loader: 
loader = get_dataloader(args)

how the function is defined
def get_dataloader(type : str = "train", percentOfDataUse : float = 1.0, batch_size : int = 1, shuffle : bool = False):
percentOfDataUse can be used to use only a small set of the data


example usage:
type = "train"
batch_size = 1
shuffle = False
fraction_of_data_to_use = 0.8
loader = get_dataloader(type, fraction_of_data_to_use, batch_size, shuffle)

the get item function returns a data class that has 6 attributes:
ex: for obj in loader:
obj.imgL = tensor of (tensor of left img (3, height, width))                        #batchsize x 3 x height x width
obj.imgR = tensor of right img (3, height, width)                                   #batchsize x 3 x height x width
obj.depthL = tensor of left depth map (height, width)                               #batchsize x height x width
obj.depthR = tensor of right depth map (height, width)                              #batchsize x height x width
obj.focalLength = tensor of (a float with the focal length in pixels for this camera pair)  #batchsize x 1
obj.baseline = tensor of (a float with the baseline in pixels for this camera pair)         #batchsize x 1
